<p>In order to post this very first post, I have overcome my comfort zone. I have never dipped my toes into web deverlopment beside the very first webpage project I did back in high school which was well over a decade now. Back then, I wrote the webpage entirely using html syntax, I did not know anything about css until College. I wish I still have that code to at least demonstrate how silly my webpage was.</p> 
<p>Fast forward to today, one night, I was thinking why not creating webpage using github since my friend host his webpage on github for some of his project. After couple search and couple videos on Youtube, I chose this Jekyll themes as it is fairly easy to modified and very intuiative. During this experience, I have also learn how to use git on terminal, which should be done a long time ago. Till this day, I still manually upload my code to my github page instead of using git. This will be another learning experience for me in the future.</p> 
<p>All in all, this exprience was quite fun. Hopefully, I can learn to modified the blog to my liking in the future after learning more about Jekyll.</p><br>
