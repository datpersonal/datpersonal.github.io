## Project I have done

### SDSU Badminton Webpage 

| Webpage:    | [SDSU Badminton Club](https://datpersonal.github.io/sdsubadminton) |

- **Description**: I created this with a friend using a different theme from jekyll. In this project, I tried to use mostly Markdown syntax in each page to improve my understanding of Markdown syntax.
