## My Story:
<p>Hello! I'm Dat Truong, and I'm currently pursuing B.S Degree in Computer Science at San Diego State University. Ever since I was young, I've had a strong passion for computers. When I got to college, I chose Computer Science as my major without hesitation.</p>
<p> However, life sometimes takes unexpected turns. Family and financial challenges delayed my graduation from Grossmont, where I earned an A.S. in Computer Science back in 2014, two years later than anticipated. Despite every effort to stay in school, unfortunately, I had to put my dreams of obtaining a B.S. degree on hold. Nevertheless, my passion for computer science never faded away.</p>
<p>Now, in my 30s, I've decided to reignite that dream and continue my education. Thanks to the support of my wife, with her encouragement, I'm able to fully focus on both my studies and my work, determined to pursue my goals once again.</p>

## My Hobbies:
### Badminton
- I like to play Badminton on the side as a sport. I am now playing competitive team for SDSU Badminton Club.
